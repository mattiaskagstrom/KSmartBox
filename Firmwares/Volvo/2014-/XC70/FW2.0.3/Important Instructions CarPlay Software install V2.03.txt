08 November 2022 Kremersino Software update notes (my own)

Update includes two seperate Updates - 
1. MCU Software V2.03 
2. System Software
It doesnt matter which is installed first.
After both installed, there is a new tab (I misssed it at first) under 
Carplay device settings, Advanvced settings (after password 8818 as before), 
Its labeled somthing like "MCU Update" once seleected - there is a (new) screen with a table of options
Top colums 0-7, and rows A-D (from memory) 
now important ONLY select A0 ie top left box - selectimg any other MAY, Im told do harm to device.
if in doubt ask..

In my initial testing (limited so far) the bigest (for me fix) is the phone (IOS mine is) now 
disconnects from Carplay after I turn off ignition and open car door - exactly as I think
it should. (it stays connected until door opened, again as it should - one may be on a phone call etc)

hope it solves any issues you have and do share your experience, issues and observations
Cheers
